    "For more customizable string creation and printing, python also includes rich formatting capability that may be familiar to developers of other high-level programming language. Some examples are below. In a nutshell, one adds placeholders to the string being constructed. These placeholders always start with a `%` followed by some additional information that determines how the data will be formatted. After the string, another `%` is used, followed by the acutal data that is to be inserted in the prior placeholders. The full capabilities of python string formatting are beyond the scope of this primer, for more info, please consult the [offical documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting)."
